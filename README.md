### Reflection

* Did the topics discussed in your labs prepare you to complete the assignment? Be specific, which features in your weekly assignment did you feel unprepared to complete?

Yes, the topics discussed in the lab helped me complete the assignment. More specifically, the props and fetching data helped me a lot.

* If you had more time, what would you have done differently? Would you have added additional features? Changed the way your project responded to a particular event, etc.
  
If I had more time, I would add a feature that would map movies to match your interests.

* Reflect on your project demo, what went well? Were there things that maybe didn't go as planned? Did you notice something that your peer did that you would like to try next time?

I feel like my sidebar component went really well. One of my peers used the same styling as Netflix to make it a copy cat which I thought was cool.

### Open-source libraries used

- Add any links to open-source libraries used in your project.

### Shout out

Give a shout out to somebody from your cohort that especially helped you during your project. This can be a fellow peer, instructor, TA, mentor, etc.

I would like to give a shoutout to Maya because she helped me debug some of my code with the favorite and watched buttons.
